                    George Denis Patrick Carlin[4] was born on May 12, 1937, in Manhattan, New York.

                <li>
                    He grew up on West 121st Street, in a neighborhood of Manhattan he said he and his
                    friends called "White Harlem" because that "sounded a lot tougher than its real name" of Morningside
                    Heights.
                </li>
                <li>

                <li>
                    During his time in the Air Force, he had been court-martialed three times, and also received many
                    nonjudicial punishments and reprimands.

                <li>
                    In 1959, Carlin met Jack Burns, a fellow DJ at radio station KXOL in Fort Worth, Texas.[16] They
                    formed a comedy team and after successful performances at Fort Worth's beat coffeehouse called The
                    Cellar, Burns and Carlin headed for California in February 1960.[4]
